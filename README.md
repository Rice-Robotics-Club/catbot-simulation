# catbot-simulation

Gazebo simulation of quadruped ros2 robot running Ros2 Humble, Gazebo Fortress.

Steps to build a simulation:
1. Import Models - (RoboForge take my children)
2. Converting said models to work with ros2_control
3. ros2_control (diff_drive_controller, joint_state_controller, and more!)
4. yaml_to_py_gazebo.launch.py - building a yaml file to launch gazebo
